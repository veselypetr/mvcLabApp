# mvcLabApp

Written in Java, and powered by Spring Boot.
Dependency management done using Maven.
The webserver used is Apache Tomcat.
Templates are done in Thymeleaf.
As the database backend I used PostgreSQL.

The application is a inventory system used in a laboratory setting (at least in theory).
It includes user management with user roles, basic authentication and security.
The user interface of the resulting web app is responsive.
